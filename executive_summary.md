# Executive Summary

## Urban Retail Co. Inventory Optimization Project

### Overview
Urban Retail Co. is a rapidly expanding retail chain facing challenges in inventory management, including frequent stockouts, overstocking, and a lack of real-time insights. Leveraging SQL-based analytics, this project transforms raw inventory and sales data into actionable insights to drive smarter inventory decisions, reduce inefficiencies, and improve profitability.

### Key Insights
1. **Stock Level Analysis** revealed significant variation in inventory across stores and regions, with some locations experiencing frequent stockouts of fast-moving products while others held excess slow-moving stock.
2. **Low Inventory Detection** identified SKUs consistently falling below reorder points, highlighting the need for more dynamic and data-driven replenishment strategies.
3. **Inventory Turnover Analysis** showed that certain categories (e.g., electronics, toys) have higher turnover rates, while others (e.g., furniture) are slow-moving, tying up working capital.
4. **KPI Summary Reports** provided visibility into stockout rates, average inventory levels, and sales performance, enabling targeted interventions.
5. **Reorder Point Estimation** using historical sales trends allows for more accurate and proactive inventory replenishment, reducing both stockouts and overstocking.
6. **Fast-selling vs. Slow-moving Product Analysis** enables the business to prioritize high-velocity SKUs and consider markdowns or promotions for slow movers.
7. **Inventory Age and Days Since Last Sale** metrics help identify obsolete or at-risk inventory.

### Recommendations
1. Implement automated, data-driven reorder point calculations for each SKU and store, factoring in sales velocity and lead times.
2. Regularly review and rebalance inventory across stores and regions to minimize both stockouts and excess stock.
3. Use inventory turnover and age metrics to inform markdown, promotion, or liquidation strategies for slow-moving items.
4. Enhance supplier performance monitoring by integrating delivery and fill rate data (future enhancement).
5. Develop dashboards for real-time monitoring of key inventory KPIs and trends.

### Expected Business Impact
- Reduced stockouts and lost sales, improving customer satisfaction.
- Lowered holding costs and improved cash flow by minimizing overstock.
- Enhanced supply chain efficiency and responsiveness.
- Data-driven decision-making culture, supporting continued growth and profitability.

This project provides a scalable foundation for ongoing inventory analytics and optimization, positioning Urban Retail Co. for operational excellence in a competitive retail landscape.
